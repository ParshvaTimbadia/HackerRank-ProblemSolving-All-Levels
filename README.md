# Why Hacker Rank?

Hacker Rank is a site for hackers from all over the world to solve programming problems in different CS domains like algorithms, machine learning and artificial intelligence, and to excel in different programming paradigms like functional programming.

The Hacker Rank team is on a mission to flatten the world by restructuring the DNA of every company on the planet. We rank programmers based on their coding skills, helping companies source great programmers and reduce the time to hire.

As a result, we are revolutionizing the way companies discover and evaluate talented engineers. The Hacker Rank platform is the destination for the best engineers to hone their skills and companies to find top engineers.

# What is the purpose of solving challenges?

### For Fun. 
What can be more exciting than solving challenging problems? We have also added helpful features to make your coding experience enjoyable, such as providing boilerplate code and displaying animations of your running code.

### Glory. 
As you solve more challenges, you will earn points, and move up in the Hacker Rank Leader board. Many challenges will also involve a competition between your bots and the bots coded by other hackers, so may the best hacker win!

### Community. 
We are building a community of hackers who will be able to discuss problems, learn, compete and collaborate together.

### Learning. 
You will be able to learn new programming topics and techniques by going through the challenges on HackerRank. We believe the way to learn something is by doing it.
